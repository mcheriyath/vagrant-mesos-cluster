# ElasticSearch and Kibana (from a docker container)
#
# See https://hub.docker.com/_/elasticsearch/
# See https://hub.docker.com/_/kibana/
#
# You shouldn't run ES in this way (at least until you move its data/logs dirs outside the container),
# so that is just an academical example which can be quickly deployed :)
